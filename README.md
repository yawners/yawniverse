Yawning is one of the most contagious things in the world. How long can you resist the urge to yawn?

Try it with this amazing game! [https://yawners.github.io/yawniverse/](https://yawners.github.io/yawniverse/)

## How it works

Relaxing (or distressing piano music), beautiful pink clouds, random yawning GIFs and Sounds. Look at the screen and see how long you can go.

Our open-mouth detection algorithm will analyze your webcam image and detect if you yawn. There's no way to fool it.
